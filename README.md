# Darwin World

This is a simple object-oriented game project created for the *Object-Oriented Design* course at the **Faculty of Computer Science**, **AGH University of Science and Technology**.

## ðŸŽ® About the Project

The simulation features a population of monkeys living in a virtual world. Monkeys can:

- Move around the world,
- Eat plants that grow over time,
- Reproduce when certain conditions are met,
- Die if they run out of energy (which they get from eating).

The project is written in **Java** and focuses on object-oriented programming concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and threads.

## ðŸ“š Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-oriented programming principles

## ðŸ§  Authors

This project was developed as part of coursework at AGH University by two students:  
**Krzysztof Pieczka and Zuzanna Jedynak!**
